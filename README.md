## Hi there!! 👋  I'm Giacomo 😎

I'm developer, **frontend** oriented, with a big passion for IT. I like writing **JavaScript/TypeScript**, **HTML** and **CSS(Scss)** code to development web and mobile applications, and websites. I currently work with [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).

I love outdoor sports and nature 🏔
